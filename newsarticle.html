            Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting communities around the world. 
            However, the impact of climate change is felt disproportionately by vulnerable populations, including low-income groups, 
            indigenous people, and those living in coastal areas. These communities often lack the resources to adapt to or mitigate 
            the effects of climate change, leading to severe consequences.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            Rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and extreme weather patterns are all consequences of climate change 
            that threaten the livelihood of these populations. Coastal communities face the risk of being displaced due to rising waters, 
            while farmers in rural areas struggle with unpredictable rainfall patterns that affect food production.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            Governments and organizations must work together to implement policies that protect vulnerable communities. 
            This includes investment in sustainable infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and access to clean energy. 
            It is essential to prioritize the needs of those most affected by climate change to ensure a fair and just transition 
            to a more sustainable future.
